        <p>I was born in September 15, 2003 in Sumgayit city. When I was 5 years old, we moved to Baku with my family. I went to Secondary school No:25 in 2010. When I was at 10th grade, I started learning English. After completing a 6-month course, I took several International exams such as SAT(1340), TOEFL(102), IELTS(6.5), Duolingo(120). With the help of these results, I have enrolled ADA University. In april 2021, I started working as a math instructor at <strong>CELT COLLEGES</strong>. Currently I am focused on my career in Computer Science. Therefore, I have applied internships which are held abroad.</p>
