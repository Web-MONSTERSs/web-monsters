        <h1 style="margin-top:20px;justify-content: center;text-align: center">HOW I CAME WHERE I AM NOW</h1>
        <p> 2 Years ago I started practicing SAT unfortunately because of pandemic I couldn't take my exam, so I started preparing for both SAT and TQDK exams. After my second and third exam got canceled because of pandemic my parents started to worry that my next attempt that was going to be at March will also be canceled we decided so we decided to stop SAT and prepare for TQDK. 2 month before exam we understood that it is not going to be canceled so I started preparing for it and got needed score</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center">FAVOURITE BOOK</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">I guess that from books that I read my personal favourite is 'MARTYR' written by Evenson. It is sci-fi horror that was written in universe of game series named 'DEAD SPACE'. I dont like horror or sci-fi books but this one of few books that was one of few that had great balance between story and horror elements to scary me but at the same time gives me interesting story</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">FAVOURITE FILM</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">'Drive' in my opinion is one of the best films. Neo-noir is one of my favourite style and when it is mixed with action it automatically adds to my top of the movies. Drive dont have many action scenes but when it comes to action Nicolas Winding Refn shows all his talent and these scenes will get stuck in your head for a long time moreover it catches your attention by using 'light navigation' and good work with shadows</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center">FAVOURITE ANIME</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">My favourite anime is Evangelion. This anime was made more than 20 years ago, but 'Rebuild' of this anime only ended this summer. This shows has one of the best stories in anime or movies I have ever seen. This show starts as normal anime for teens and first five series you won't understand why it was give 18+, but when you will end this anime you will think how it didn't get banned ofc if you will be able to think after it. This is mostly true to the film 'The End Of Evangelion', or scene at the hospital.</p>
